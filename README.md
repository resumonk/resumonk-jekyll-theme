Resumonk Blog Template
======================

At [Resumonk](http://www.resumonk.com), we have started using Jekyll as our blogging platform. I've just finished designing a Jekyll theme to match our website's design. Since there aren't many Jekyll themes out there, I thought I'd release this in the public domain. I hope you find this useful.

#### Here's how this theme looks - [Demo](http://www.resumonk.com/blog)

This theme uses Open Sans provided by Google Web Fonts and the Foundation 4 framework provided by Zurb.

The theme is responsive and works seamlessly across multiple screen resolutions and devices.
