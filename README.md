Resumonk Blog Template
======================

At [Resumonk](http://www.resumonk.com), we have started using Jekyll as our blogging platform. We've just finished designing a Jekyll theme to match our website's design. Since there aren't many Jekyll themes out there, we thought we'd release this in the public domain. we hope you find this useful.

#### Here's how this theme looks - [Demo](http://www.resumonk.com/blog)
